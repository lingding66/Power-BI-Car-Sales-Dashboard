1. Project Scope
The purpose of this project was to design and develop an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize car sales data across multiple dimensions such as company, model, region, color, and body style. The dashboard provides both high-level summaries and detailed insights to support decision-making in sales strategy, inventory management, and customer preferences.

2, Key deliverables included:

YTD and MTD performance overview

Sales breakdown by region, dealer, body style, and color

Trend analysis of weekly sales

Filterable detailed view of individual transactions

3, Key Business Questions Answered

What is the overall car sales performance year-to-date and month-to-date?

Which car body styles and colors are most popular among buyers?

How are sales distributed across different regions and dealers?

What are the trends in weekly car sales performance?

Which companies and models generate the most revenue and unit sales?

How is the average selling price changing over time?

4, Key Findings and Insights

Sales Performance:

YTD total sales reached $371.2M, with a strong MTD contribution of $54.28M.

A total of 13.3K cars were sold YTD, a 19.73% increase (+2.6K units).

The average sale price is $28.0K, showing a slight decline of $220 (-0.79%).

Color Preferences:

Pale White, Black, and Red are the top three most sold car colors.

These preferences may indicate a trend toward classic and neutral vehicle aesthetics.

Body Style Preferences:

SUVs and Sedans are the leading categories in terms of sales volume.

Hardtop and Passenger styles accounted for the least number of sales.

Top Performing Companies:

Companies like Toyota, Ford, and Chevrolet contributed significantly to overall sales volume.

Cadillac showed the highest average sales price ($31.5K), indicating premium positioning.

Regional and Dealer Insights:

High-performing regions included Pasco, Aurora, Westfield, and Madisonville.

These regions could be targeted for additional marketing and supply chain support.

Sales Trends:

Weekly sales peaked at $14.9M, with noticeable fluctuations throughout the year.

This suggests the impact of external factors such as promotions, seasons, or market conditions.

This dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor performance, identify top-selling segments, and make informed, data-driven decisions for sales planning and optimization.
